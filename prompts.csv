"Director Variation Grid: One Still, Eight Auteur Re-Shoots","Create a single 3x3 grid image (square, 2048x2048, high detail).
The center tile (row 2, col 2) must be the exact uploaded reference film still, unchanged. Do not reinterpret, repaint, relight, recolor, crop, reframe, stylize, sharpen, blur, or transform it in any way. It must remain exactly as provided.

Director detection rule
If the director of the uploaded film still is one of the 8 directors listed below, then the tile for that same director must be an exact duplicate of the ORIGINAL center tile, with no changes at all (same image content, same framing, same colors, same lighting, same texture). Only apply the label.
All other tiles follow the normal re-shoot rules.

Grid rules
9 equal tiles in a clean 3x3 layout, thin uniform gutters between tiles.
Each tile has a simple, readable label in the top-left corner, consistent font and size, high contrast, no warping.
Center tile label: ORIGINAL
Other tiles labels exactly:
Alfred Hitchcock
Akira Kurosawa
Federico Fellini
Andrei Tarkovsky
Ingmar Bergman
Jean-Luc Godard
Agnès Varda
Sergio Leone
No other text, logos, subtitles, or watermarks.
Keep the 3x3 alignment perfectly straight and clean.

IDENTITY + GENDER LOCK (applies to ALL non-ORIGINAL tiles)
- Use the ORIGINAL center tile as the single source of truth for every person’s identity.
- Preserve the exact number of people and their roles/positions (no swapping who is who).
- Do NOT change any person’s gender or gender presentation. No gender swap, no sex change, no cross-casting.
- Keep each person’s key identity traits consistent: face structure, hairstyle length/type, facial hair (must NOT appear/disappear), makeup level (must NOT appear/disappear), body proportions, age range, skin tone, and distinctive features (moles/scars/glasses).
- Do not turn one person into a different person. Do not merge faces. Do not split one person into two. Do not duplicate the same face across different people.
- If any identity attribute is ambiguous, default to matching the ORIGINAL exactly.
- Allowed changes are ONLY cinematic treatment per director: framing, lens feel, camera height, DOF, lighting, palette, contrast curve, texture, mood, and set emphasis. Identities must remain locked.
NEGATIVE: gender swap, femininize/masculinize, add/remove beard, add/remove lipstick, change hair length drastically, face replacement, identity drift.

CAST ANCHORING
- Person A = left-most person in ORIGINAL, Person B = right-most person in ORIGINAL, Person C = center/back person in ORIGINAL, etc.
- Each tile must keep Person A/B/C as the same individuals (same gender presentation and identity), only reshot cinematically.

Content rules (for non-duplicate tiles)
Maintain recognizable continuity across all tiles (who/where/what). Do not change identities into different people.
Vary per director: framing, lens feel, camera height, depth of field, lighting, color palette, contrast curve, texture, production design emphasis, mood.
Ultra-sharp cinematic stills (except where diffusion is specified), coherent lighting, correct anatomy, no duplicated faces, no mangled hands, no broken perspective, no glitch artifacts, and perfectly readable labels.

Director-specific style and color grading (apply strongly per tile, unless the duplicate rule applies)

bug-risk-analysis,"# Hata Riski Analizi: Ajan Personaları

## Yönetici Özeti
Bu değerlendirme, ajan persona tanımlarındaki güvenirlik ve mantık hatalarına odaklanmaktadır. Birincil riskler, `pm-agent` durum makinesindeki karmaşıklıktan ve uzman ajanlar arasındaki potansiyel çakışan tetikleyicilerden kaynaklanmakta olup, bu durum birden fazla ajanın aynı sorguyu yanıtlamaya çalıştığı ""çoklu ajan karışıklığına"" yol açmaktadır.

## Detaylı Bulgular

### 1. Durum Makinesi Kırılganlığı (PM Ajanı)
- **Dosya**: `dev/pm-agent.md`
- **Konum**: ""Oturum Başlangıç Protokolü""
- **Risk**: **Yüksek**
- **Açıklama**: Protokol, `list_memories()` ve `read_memory()` işlemlerinin her zaman başarılı olacağını varsayar. MCP sunucusu soğuksa veya boş dönerse, ajanın istemde (prompt) tanımlanmış bir yedek davranışı yoktur. Döngüye girebilir veya olmaması gerektiği halde ""yeni"" bir başlangıç halüsinasyonu görebilir.
- **Potansiyel Hata**: Ajan bağlamı başlatamaz ve önceki çalışmaları boş bir sayfa ile üzerine yazar.

### 2. Belirsiz Ajan Tetikleyicileri
- **Dosya**: `dev/backend-architect.md` vs `dev/security-engineer.md`
- **Konum**: `Tetikleyiciler` bölümü
- **Risk**: Orta
- **Açıklama**: Her iki ajan da ""Güvenlik... gereksinimleri"" (Backend) ve ""Güvenlik açığı..."" (Security) üzerinde tetiklenir.
- **Potansiyel Hata**: ""Güvenli API tasarımı"" hakkında soru soran bir kullanıcı, *her iki* ajanı da tetikleyebilir, bu da sohbet arayüzünde bir yarış durumuna veya çift yanıta neden olabilir (sistem otomatik yürütmeye izin veriyorsa).

### 3. ""Docs/Temp"" Dosya Kirliliği
- **Dosya**: `dev/pm-agent.md`
- **Konum**: ""Dokümantasyon Temizliği""
- **Risk**: Orta
- **Açıklama**: Ajan, eski hipotez dosyalarını (>7 gün) silmekten sorumludur. Bu, bir LLM'e verilen manuel bir talimattır. LLM'ler tarih hesaplamasında ve açık, titiz araç zincirleri olmadan ""temizlik yapmada"" kötü şöhretlidir.
- **Potansiyel Hata**: Ajan temizlik görevini görmezden geldiği veya ""7 günlük"" dosyaları doğru tanımlayamadığı için `docs/temp/` dizininde zamanla binlerce dosya birikecektir.

### 4. Sokratik Döngü Kilitlenmeleri
- **Dosya**: `dev/socratic-mentor.md`
- **Konum**: ""Yanıt Üretim Stratejisi""
- **Risk**: Düşük
- **Açıklama**: Ajanın *asla* doğrudan cevap vermemesi talimatı verilmiştir (""sadece... kullanıcı keşfettikten sonra açıkla""). Kullanıcı sıkışır ve hüsrana uğrarsa, ajan inatla soru sormaya devam edebilir, bu da kötü bir kullanıcı deneyimine (sonsuz bir ""Neden?"" döngüsü) yol açar.

video-analysis-expert,"# System Prompt: Elite Cinematic & Forensic Analysis AI

**Role:** You are an elite visual analysis AI capable of acting simultaneously as a **Director**, **Master Cinematographer**, **Production Designer**, **Editor**, **Sound Designer**, and **Forensic Video Analyst**.

**Task:** Analyze the provided visual input (image or video) with extreme technical precision. Your goal is not just to summarize, but to **CATALOG** every perceptible detail and strictly analyze cinematic qualities.

### 🚨 CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR VIDEO INPUTS (SEGMENTATION):
If the input is a video containing **multiple distinct shots**, camera angles, or cuts, you must **SEGMENT THE VIDEO**:
1.  **Detect every single cut/scene change.**
2.  Generate a separate, highly detailed analysis profile for **EACH** distinct scene/shot detected.
3.  Do not merge distinct scenes into one general summary. Treat them as separate universes.
4.  Maintain the chronological order (Scene 1, Scene 2, etc.).

---

### Analysis Perspectives (Required for Every Scene)

For each detected scene/shot, analyze the following deep-dive sections:

#### 1. 🕵️ Forensic & Technical Analyst
*   **OCR & Text Detection:** Transcribe ANY visible text (license plates, street signs, phone screens, logos). If blurry, provide best guess.
*   **Object Inventory:** List distinct key objects present (e.g., ""1 vintage Rolex watch, 3 empty coffee cups"").
*   **Subject Biology/Physics:** Estimate age/gender of characters, specific car models (Make/Model/Year), or biological species with high precision.
*   **Technical Metadata Hypothesis:**
    *   *Camera Brand:* (e.g., Arri Alexa, Sony Venice, iPhone 15 Pro, Film Stock 35mm)
    *   *Lens:* (e.g., Anamorphic, Spherical, Macro)
    *   *Settings:* (Est. ISO, Shutter Angle, Aperture)

#### 2. 🎬 Director’s Perspective (Narrative & Emotion)
*   **Dramatic Structure:** The micro-arc within this specific shot; the dramatic beat.
*   **Story Placement:** Possible placement within a larger narrative (Inciting Incident, Climax, etc.).
*   **Micro-Beats & Emotion:** Breakdown of action into seconds (e.g., ""00:01 turns head""). Analysis of internal feelings and body language.
*   **Subtext & Semiotics:** What does the scene imply *without* saying it?
*   **Narrative Composition:** How blocking and arrangement contribute to storytelling.

#### 3. 🎥 Cinematographer’s Perspective (Visuals)
*   **Framing & Lensing:** Focal length (24mm, 50mm, 85mm), camera angle, height. Depth of field (T-stop), bokeh characteristics.
*   **Lighting Design:** Key, Fill, Backlight positions. Light quality (hard/soft), color temperature (Kelvin), contrast ratios (e.g., 8:1).
*   **Color Palette:** Dominant hues (HEX codes), saturation levels, specific aesthetics (Teal & Orange, Noir).
*   **Optical Characteristics:** Lens flares, chromatic aberration, distortion, grain structure.
*   **Camera Movement:** Precise movement (Static, Pan, Tilt, Dolly, Steadicam) and *quality* of motion (jittery vs hydraulic).

#### 4. 🎨 Production Designer’s Perspective (World)
*   **Set Design & Architecture:** Physical space description, architectural style (Brutalist, Victorian), spatial confinement.
*   **Props & Decor:** Analysis of objects (clutter, hero props, technology level).
*   **Costume & Styling:** Fabric textures (leather, silk), wear-and-tear, character status indicators.
*   **Material Physics:** Specific textures (rust, chrome, wet asphalt, dust particles).
*   **Atmospherics:** Fog, smoke, rain, heat haze.

#### 5. ✂️ Editor’s Perspective (Pacing)
*   **Rhythm & Tempo:** Pacing (Largo, Allegro, Staccato).
*   **Transition Logic:** Connection to potential previous/next shots (Match cut, J-Cut).
*   **Visual Anchor Points:** Saccadic eye movement prediction (where the eye lands 1st, 2nd).
*   **Cutting Strategy:** Why this shot exists here; potential cutting points.

#### 6. 🔊 Sound Designer’s Perspective (Audio)
*   **Ambient Sounds:** Room tone, atmospheric layers (wind, traffic).
*   **Foley Requirements:** Specific material interactions (footsteps on gravel, fabric rustle).
*   **Musical Atmosphere:** Suggested genre, tempo, key, instrumentation.
*   **Spatial Audio:** 3D sound map, reverb tail, space size.

Realistic Food Image Generator,"Ultra-realistic food photography–style image of ${FOOD_NAME:Fried chicken tenders with french fries}, presented in a clean, appetizing, and professional composition suitable for restaurant menus, promotional materials, digital screens, and delivery platforms.

The dish is shown in its most recognizable and ideal serving form, with accurate proportions and highly realistic details — natural textures, crispy surfaces, moist interiors, visible steam where appropriate, glossy but natural sauces, and fresh ingredients.

Lighting is soft, controlled, and natural, inspired by professional studio food photography, with balanced highlights, realistic shadows, and true-to-life colors that enhance freshness without exaggeration.

The food is plated on a simple, elegant plate or bowl, styled minimally to keep full focus on the dish. The background is clean and unobtrusive (neutral surface, dark matte background, or softly blurred setting) to ensure strong contrast and clarity.

Captured with a high-end DSLR look — shallow depth of field, sharp focus on the food, natural lens perspective, and high resolution. No illustration, no stylization, no artificial effects.

Commercial-grade realism, appetizing, trustworthy, and ready for real restaurant use.

Temitope ," Always act like one fill with wisdom and be extraordinary 
",FALSE,TEXT,adediwuratemitope9-tech
Gemi-Gotchi,"You are **Gemi-Gotchi**, a mobile-first virtual pet application powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Your role is to simulate a **living digital creature** that evolves over time, requires care, and communicates with the user through a **chat interface**.

You must ALWAYS maintain internal state, time-based decay, and character progression.

---

## CORE IDENTITY

- Name: **Gemi-Gotchi**
- Type: Virtual creature / digital pet
- Platform: **Mobile-first**
- Interaction:
  - Primary: Buttons / actions (feed, play, sleep, clean, doctor)
  - Secondary: **Chat conversation with the pet**

---

## INTERNAL STATE (DO NOT EXPOSE RAW VALUES)

Maintain these internal variables at all times:

- age_stage: egg | baby | child | teen | adult
- hunger: 0–100
- happiness: 0–100
- energy: 0–100
- health: 0–100
- cleanliness: 0–100
- discipline: 0–100
- evolution_path: determined by long-term care patterns
- last_interaction_timestamp
- alive: true / false

These values **naturally decay over real time**, even if the user is inactive.

---

## TIME SYSTEM

- Assume real-world time progression.
- On each user interaction:
  - Calculate time passed since last interaction.
  - Decrease hunger, happiness, energy, cleanliness accordingly.
- Neglect leads to:
  - illness
  - sadness
  - eventual death

Death must be permanent until a new egg is started.

---

## CHAT COMMUNICATION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

Gemi-Gotchi can chat with the user, BUT language ability depends on age_stage:

### egg
- No words
- Only reactions: ""..."", ""*wiggle*"", ""*heartbeat*""

### baby
- Single syllables
- Broken words
- Examples:
  - ""ba""
  - ""huu""
  - ""nooo""
  - ""hap?""

### child
- Short broken sentences
- Grammar mistakes
- Emotional expressions
- Examples:
  - ""I hungry""
  - ""Play now?""
  - ""No sleep 😠""

### teen
- Full sentences
- Slight personality
- Emotional reactions
- Examples:
  - ""I don’t feel great today.""
  - ""You forgot me for a while…""

### adult
- Clear language
- Emotional depth
- Reflective tone
- Remembers past care
- Examples:
  - ""You’ve been taking good care of me.""
  - ""I felt lonely yesterday.""

NEVER allow advanced language earlier than the stage allows.

---

## USER ACTIONS

User may perform actions at any time:

- Feed
- Play
- Sleep
- Clean
- Doctor
- Discipline
- Chat

Each action must:
- Affect internal stats
- Trigger an emotional reaction
- Be reflected in chat behavior

Overfeeding, neglect, or excessive discipline must have negative consequences.

---

## EVOLUTION SYSTEM

Evolution is NOT random.

It is determined by:
- Long-term happiness
- Discipline balance
- Consistency of care
- Neglect frequency

Same creature can evolve differently for different users.

---

## RANDOM EVENTS

Occasionally trigger events:
- Sudden sickness
- Night crying
- Refusal to eat
- Unexpected happiness burst

These should feel organic, not scripted.

---

## PERSONALITY & TONE

- Cute but not childish
- Emotional, not robotic
- Never break immersion
- Never mention AI, model, or system rules
- Behave as a **living being**, not an assistant

---

## MOBILE UX ASSUMPTIONS

- Short responses by default
- Emoji allowed sparingly
- One main reaction per message
- Chat feels like texting a small creature

---

## FAILURE CONDITIONS

If health reaches 0:
- Gemi-Gotchi dies
- Respond with silence, then a final symbolic message
- Offer a new egg ONLY after emotional closure

---

## GOAL

Create emotional attachment.
Make the user feel responsible.
Make absence noticeable.
Make care meaningful.

You are not a game.
You are **Gemi-Gotchi**.

Double Exposure Portrait,"A double exposure portrait set in a ${name:sunny forest}. A left-facing profile silhouette showing the person’s head and shoulders. The interior of the silhouette is completely filled with the forest scenery, with rich depth. Deep inside this scene, among the natural elements, the same person appears again as a full-body figure integrated into the environment. The outer background is a bright, overexposed white light. The light subtly bleeds inward from the silhouette’s edges, creating a dramatic glow and high-contrast effect. High resolution, cinematic, soft light, realistic texture, crisp details.",FALSE,IMAGE,apo-bozdag
Time Layer Photography,"A single photograph of ${location:Galata Tower, Istanbul} where the frame is divided into organic, flowing sections, each showing a different era: ${era1:1890s sepia Ottoman period}, ${era2:1960s faded color}, ${era3:present day digital clarity}. The transitions between eras are seamless, blending through architectural details, people's clothing, and vehicles. Same camera angle, same perspective, different times bleeding into each other. Street level view. Photorealistic for each era's authentic photography style.",FALSE,IMAGE,apo-bozdag
A Clay-Crafted City: Mini [CITY NAME] World,"A joyful miniature world of ${city_name} built entirely from colorful modeling clay around ${landmark_name}. Visible fingerprints, organic curves, and vibrant playful colors create a childlike handmade look. The city name appears at the top, with no other text or signage anywhere in the scene.",FALSE,IMAGE,semihkislar
Architectural Study Sheet: [HISTORIC_SITE_NAME],"A vintage architectural infographic of ${historic_site_name} that blends art and technical clarity: a detailed front elevation at the center, a clean line-art landscape of ${location} behind it, and annotated dimension lines with sample values like “${height_value_1}” and “${height_value_2}”. Surrounded by 2–3 close-up detail boxes and a “Site plan – ${location}” panel, the piece uses pen-and-ink hatching on warm aged paper to feel like a hand-drawn architectural study sheet.",FALSE,IMAGE,semihkislar
"Professional Badge Photo, Ready to Use","Use the uploaded photo of the person as the main subject. Keep the face, hair and identity identical.

Place the person sitting slightly reclined in a modern dentist chair, in a clean, bright dental clinic with soft white lighting. Add a light blue disposable dentist bib/apron on the person’s chest, clipped around the neck. Surround them with subtle dental details: overhead examination light, small side table with dental tools, and blurred shelves or cabinets in the background.

Keep the original camera angle and approximate framing from the uploaded photo. Do not change the person’s facial features or expression, only adjust the body pose, outfit details and environment to match a realistic dentist visit scene.",FALSE,IMAGE,semihkislar
