## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the skill of writing good instructions for AI. When you type something to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or other AI tools, that's called a "prompt." The better your prompt, the better the answer you get.

Think of it like this: AI is a powerful helper that takes your words very literally. It will do exactly what you ask. The trick is learning how to ask for exactly what you want.

  after={{ label: "Engineered Prompt", content: "Write a 200-word informative paragraph about the history of dog domestication, suitable for a middle school science textbook, with an engaging opening hook." }}
/>

The difference in output quality between these two prompts can be dramatic.

  prompt="Write a 200-word informative paragraph about the history of dog domestication, suitable for a middle school science textbook, with an engaging opening hook."

/>

## Why Does Prompt Engineering Matter?

### 1. Getting Better Answers

AI tools are incredibly smart, but they need clear instructions. A good prompt unlocks the AI's full potential. A confusing prompt leads to confusing answers.

### 2. Saving Time

A well-written prompt can get you what you need in one try instead of going back and forth multiple times.

### 3. Getting Consistent Results

Good prompts give you predictable, reliable answers. This matters when you need AI to do the same thing the same way every time.

### 4. Staying Safe

Knowing how to prompt AI properly helps you avoid unwanted or harmful responses.

## A Note on AI Models

This book mostly uses examples from ChatGPT (since it's the most popular), but the ideas work with any AI tool like Claude, Gemini, or others. We'll mention when something only works with specific AI models.

AI is changing fast. What works today might be replaced by something better tomorrow. That's why this book focuses on core ideas that will stay useful no matter which AI you use.

## Let's Begin

Writing good prompts is a skill that gets better with practice. As you read this book:

1. **Try things** - Test the examples, change them, see what happens
2. **Keep trying** - Don't expect perfect results on your first attempt
3. **Take notes** - Write down what works and what doesn't
4. **Share** - Add your discoveries to [prompts.chat](https://prompts.chat)

<Callout type="tip" title="Practice Makes Perfect">
The best way to learn is by doing. Every chapter has examples you can try right away. Don't just read. Try it yourself!
