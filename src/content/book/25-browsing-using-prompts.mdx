This chapter covers how to effectively find, evaluate, and use prompts from the prompts.chat library.

## Finding the Right Prompt

### Search Strategies

**Broad to narrow:**
```
1. Start with category browsing
2. Narrow with search terms
3. Filter by tags
4. Sort by relevance or popularity
```

**Specific need:**
```
1. Search exact phrase: "code review"
2. Add qualifiers: "python code review security"
3. Filter by type: Structured prompts for JSON output
4. Check recent vs. popular
```

### Using Categories

Categories organize prompts by domain:

```
Example categories:
├── Development
│   ├── Code Review
│   ├── Documentation
│   └── Debugging
├── Writing
│   ├── Copywriting
│   ├── Technical Writing
│   └── Creative Writing
├── Business
│   ├── Analysis
│   ├── Communication
│   └── Strategy
└── Education
    ├── Tutoring
    ├── Curriculum
    └── Assessment
```

### Using Tags

Tags provide cross-cutting themes:

```
Common tags:
- #beginner-friendly
- #advanced
- #json-output
- #chain-of-thought
- #role-based
- #few-shot
- #productivity
- #coding
```

### Filtering and Sorting

```
Filter options:
- By type (Text, Structured, Image, etc.)
- By category
- By tags
- By author
- By date range

Sort options:
- Most recent
- Most popular (upvotes)
- Most used
- Relevance (when searching)
```

## Evaluating Prompt Quality

### Quality Indicators

**Positive signs:**
```
✓ Clear, specific instructions
✓ Well-documented variables
✓ Multiple upvotes
✓ Active discussion/comments
✓ Version history (shows refinement)
✓ Author with track record
✓ Complete example outputs
```

**Warning signs:**
```
⚠ Vague or overly broad
⚠ No description or context
⚠ Zero engagement
⚠ Outdated (if time-sensitive)
⚠ No variable documentation
⚠ Overly complex without explanation
```

### Reading Prompt Details

**What to check:**

```
1. Title — Does it match your need?
2. Description — Context and use case
3. Content — The actual prompt
4. Variables — What you can customize
5. Type — Text, Structured, etc.
6. Tags — Related topics
7. Comments — User experiences
8. Versions — Has it been improved?
```

### Testing Before Committing

```
Before using a prompt extensively:
1. Try it with sample input
2. Check output quality
3. Test edge cases
4. Verify it works with your AI tool
5. Note any modifications needed
```

## Using Prompts Effectively

### Basic Usage

```
1. Find prompt you want to use
2. Click "Copy" button
3. Paste into your AI interface
4. Add your specific content/query
5. Run and evaluate output
```

### Using Variables

**Interactive variable filling:**
```
1. Click on prompt with variables
2. Platform shows variable input fields
3. Fill in your values
4. Preview the completed prompt
5. Copy the customized version
```

**Manual variable replacement:**
```
Original: "Write a \${length} word \${type} about \${topic}"

Your values:
- length: 500
- type: blog post  
- topic: sustainable gardening

Result: "Write a 500 word blog post about sustainable gardening"
```

### Variable Best Practices

```
DO:
✓ Read variable descriptions
✓ Use appropriate values for context
✓ Test with different variable combinations
✓ Note which values work best

DON'T:
✗ Leave variables unfilled
✗ Use values that conflict with prompt intent
✗ Ignore default values without reason
```

## Adapting Prompts

### When to Adapt

```
Adapt when:
- Prompt is close but not exact fit
- Your context differs from author's
- You need different output format
- You want to combine techniques
```

### Safe Adaptations

```
Low-risk changes:
- Adjusting length requirements
- Changing tone/style
- Adding specific context
- Tweaking output format

Higher-risk changes:
- Removing constraints
- Changing core structure
- Combining multiple prompts
- Altering role significantly
```

### Documentation When Adapting

```
Keep notes:
- Original prompt (source link)
- What you changed
- Why you changed it
- How well it works
- Further improvements needed
```
