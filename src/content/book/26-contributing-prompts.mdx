## Writing Quality Prompts

4. Format (how to structure output)
5. Variables (customization points)
```

### Example: Well-Structured Prompt

```
Title: Technical Blog Post Writer

Description: Creates engaging technical blog posts with proper 
structure, code examples, and SEO optimization.

Content:
You are an experienced technical writer who creates engaging 
blog posts for developers.

Write a blog post about \${topic}.

Requirements:
- Length: \${word_count:800} words
- Audience: \${audience:intermediate developers}

- Structure with clear headings
- Add a compelling introduction hook
- End with actionable takeaways

Tone: \${tone:professional but approachable}

Format:
# [Title]
[Introduction - hook the reader]
## [Section 1]
[Content with code example]
## [Section 2]
[Content with code example]
## Conclusion
[Summary and call-to-action]
```

### Variable Guidelines

```
When to use variables:
- Customizable values (names, topics, numbers)
- Options that might vary (tone, length, format)
- Context-specific details

Variable naming:
- Use snake_case: \${word_count}
- Be descriptive: \${target_audience} not \${ta}
- Include defaults: \${format:markdown}

Documenting variables:
- List all variables in description
- Explain expected values
- Provide examples
```

## Prompt Types Deep Dive

### Text Prompts

Standard prompts for general use:
```
- Most common type
- Flexible output
- No special formatting requirements
```

### Structured Prompts

For JSON or YAML output:
```
Type: STRUCTURED
Format: JSON or YAML

Content should specify exact schema:
"Return as JSON:
{
  \"field1\": \"type\",
  \"field2\": \"type\"
}"

Benefits:
- Consistent output
- Easy to parse
- Clear expectations
```

### Image Prompts

For image generation:
```
Type: IMAGE

Best practices:
- Include style descriptors
- Specify composition
- Note technical requirements
- Provide negative prompts if relevant
```

### Media-Required Prompts

When users need to upload files:
```
Enable: "Requires Media Upload"
Specify:
- Media type (Image/Video/Document)
- Number of files required
- What to include in media
```
