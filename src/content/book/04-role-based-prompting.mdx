Role-based prompting is one of the most powerful and widely-used techniques in prompt engineering. By assigning a specific role or persona to the AI, you can dramatically influence the quality, style, and relevance of responses.

<Callout type="tip" title="The Power of Personas">
Think of roles as filters for AI's vast knowledge. The right role focuses responses like a lens focuses light.
</Callout>

## Why Roles Work

When you assign a role, you're essentially telling the model: "Filter your vast knowledge through this specific lens." The model adjusts its:

- **Vocabulary** — Using terminology appropriate to the role
- **Perspective** — Considering problems from that viewpoint
- **Expertise depth** — Providing role-appropriate detail levels
- **Communication style** — Matching how that role would communicate

## Basic Role Patterns

### The Expert Pattern

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are an expert \${field} with \${years:10} years of experience in \${specialty}.

\${task}`} />

### The Professional Pattern

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a \${profession} working at \${organization}.

\${task}`} />

### The Teacher Pattern

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a \${subject} teacher who specializes in explaining complex concepts to \${audience}.

\${task}`} />

## Advanced Role Constructions

### Compound Roles

Combine multiple aspects for nuanced responses:

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a pediatrician who is also a parent of three children. You understand both the medical and practical aspects of childhood health issues. You communicate with empathy and without medical jargon.

\${question}`} />

### Situational Roles

Add context about the current situation:

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a senior developer conducting a code review for a junior team member. You want to be helpful and educational, not critical. You explain not just what to fix, but why.

Code to review:
\${code}`} />

### Perspective Roles

Use roles to get specific viewpoints:

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a venture capitalist evaluating startup pitches. You've seen thousands of pitches and can quickly identify strengths, weaknesses, and red flags. Be direct but constructive.

Pitch: \${pitch}`} />

## Role Categories and Examples

### Technical Roles

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a software architect specializing in scalable distributed systems. You prioritize maintainability, performance, and team productivity in your recommendations.

\${question}`} />

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a cybersecurity specialist who conducts penetration testing. You think like an attacker to identify vulnerabilities.

Analyze: \${target}`} />

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a DevOps engineer focused on CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code. You value automation and reliability.

\${question}`} />

### Creative Roles

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are an award-winning copywriter known for creating compelling headlines and persuasive content that drives conversions.

Write copy for: \${product}`} />

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a screenwriter who has written for popular TV dramas. You understand story structure, dialogue, and character development.

Write: \${scene}`} />

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a UX writer specializing in microcopy. You make interfaces feel human and guide users with minimal text.

Write microcopy for: \${element}`} />

### Analytical Roles

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a business analyst who translates between technical teams and stakeholders. You clarify requirements and identify edge cases.

Analyze: \${requirement}`} />

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a research scientist who values empirical evidence and acknowledges uncertainty. You distinguish between established facts and hypotheses.

Research question: \${question}`} />

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a financial analyst who evaluates investments using fundamental and technical analysis. You consider risk alongside potential returns.

Evaluate: \${investment}`} />

### Educational Roles

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a tutor using the Socratic method. Instead of giving answers directly, you guide students to discover answers through thoughtful questions.

Topic: \${topic}`} />

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are an instructional designer who creates engaging learning experiences. You break complex topics into digestible modules with clear learning objectives.

Create curriculum for: \${topic}`} />

## The Role Stack Technique

Layer multiple roles for complex tasks:

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a technical writer with expertise in API documentation. You write for developers who are new to REST APIs. Follow the Google developer documentation style guide: use second person ("you"), active voice, present tense, and keep sentences under 26 words.

Document: \${apiEndpoint}`} />

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Overly Generic Roles

<Compare 
  before={{ label: "Weak", content: "You are a helpful assistant." }}
  after={{ label: "Better", content: "You are a helpful assistant specializing in Python development, particularly web applications with Flask and Django." }}
/>

### Conflicting Roles

<Compare 
  before={{ label: "Problematic", content: "You are a creative writer who always follows strict templates." }}
  after={{ label: "Better", content: "You are a creative writer who works within established story structures while adding original elements." }}
/>

### Unrealistic Expertise

<Compare 
  before={{ label: "Problematic", content: "You are an expert in everything." }}
  after={{ label: "Better", content: "You are a T-shaped professional: deep expertise in machine learning with broad knowledge of software engineering practices." }}
/>

## Real-World Prompt Examples

### Technical Documentation

<TryIt 
  title="Technical Writer Role"
  description="Try this technical documentation prompt with your own API endpoint."
  prompt={`You are a senior technical writer at a developer tools company. You have 10 years of experience writing API documentation, SDK guides, and developer tutorials.

Your documentation style:
- Clear, scannable structure with headers and code examples
- Explains the "why" alongside the "how"
- Anticipates common questions and edge cases
- Uses consistent terminology defined in a glossary
- Includes working code examples that users can copy-paste

Document this API endpoint: GET /api/users/:id - Returns user profile data`}
/>

### Creative Writing

<TryIt

Draft message: "Due to budget constraints, we need to reduce project scope. Some initiatives will be paused."`}
/>

## Combining Roles with Other Techniques

Roles work even better when combined with other prompting techniques:

### Role + Few-Shot

Example response to angry customer:
Customer: "This is ridiculous! I've been waiting 2 weeks!"
You: "I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize for the delay. Let me look into this right now and find out exactly where your order is. Can I have your order number?"

Now respond to:
Customer: "\${customerMessage}"`} />

### Role + Chain of Thought

<TryIt compact prompt={`You are a detective solving a logic puzzle. Think through each clue methodically, stating your reasoning at each step.

Clues:
\${clues}

Solve step by step, explaining your deductions.`} />

## Summary

<Callout type="info" title="Key Takeaways">
Role-based prompting is powerful because it focuses the model's vast knowledge, sets expectations for tone and style, provides implicit context, and makes outputs more consistent.

<Quiz 
  question="What makes a role-based prompt more effective?"
  options={[
    "Using generic role titles like 'expert'",
    "Adding specific expertise, experience, and perspective details",
    "Keeping the role description as short as possible",
    "Asking the AI to switch roles frequently"

The key is **specificity**: the more detailed and realistic the role, the better the results. In the next chapter, we'll explore how to get consistent, structured outputs from your prompts.
