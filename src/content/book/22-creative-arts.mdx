AI is a powerful creative collaborator. This chapter covers prompting techniques for visual arts, music, game design, and other creative domains.

## Visual Art & Design

### Image Prompt Crafting

When working with image generation models (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion):

```
Create an image prompt for [concept].

Structure:
[Subject] + [Action/Pose] + [Setting/Background] + [Style] + 
[Lighting] + [Mood] + [Technical specs]

Example:
"A wise elderly wizard reading an ancient tome, sitting in a 
tower library at sunset, fantasy art style, warm golden lighting, 
contemplative mood, highly detailed, 4K"
```

### Art Direction

```
Describe artwork for [project/scene].

Include:
1. **Composition** - arrangement of elements
2. **Color palette** - specific colors and their relationships
3. **Style reference** - similar artists/works/movements
4. **Focal point** - where the eye should be drawn
5. **Mood/Atmosphere** - emotional quality
6. **Technical approach** - medium, technique

Purpose: [illustration/concept art/marketing/personal]
```

### Design Critique

```

- Actionable suggestions
```

### Creative Constraints

```
Give me creative constraints for [project type].

I want constraints that:
- Force unexpected choices

2. ...

Then show one example of how applying these constraints 
transforms a generic concept into something interesting.

## Creative Collaboration Tips

### Building on Ideas

```
I have this creative idea: [idea]

Help me develop it by:
1. What's working well
2. Questions to explore
3. Unexpected directions
4. Potential challenges
5. First three development steps

Don't replace my vision—enhance it.
```

### Creative Feedback

```
Give me feedback on this creative work:

[work]

As a [fellow creator/editor/audience member]:
1. What resonates most strongly
2. What feels underdeveloped
3. What's confusing or unclear
4. One bold suggestion
5. What would make this unforgettable

Be honest but constructive.
```

## Summary

Creative prompts work best when they:
- Provide enough structure to guide without constraining
- Embrace specificity (vague prompts = generic results)
- Include references and inspirations
- Request variations and alternatives
- Maintain your creative vision while exploring possibilities

AI is a collaborator, not a replacement for creative vision. Use it to explore, generate options, and overcome blocks—but the creative decisions remain yours.
