      3. Why? [Deeper still]
         4. Why? [Approaching root]
            5. Why? [Root cause]

Alternative: Fishbone diagram categories
- People
- Process
- Equipment
- Materials
- Environment

Provide: Root cause(s) + recommended actions
```

### Gap Analysis

```
Conduct a gap analysis for [topic/organization].

**Current State:**
- [Where we are now - specific metrics/descriptions]

**Desired State:**
- [Where we want to be - specific goals]

**Gap Identification:**
| Area | Current | Desired | Gap | Priority |
|------|---------|---------|-----|----------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | H/M/L |

**Action Plan:**

## Prompt Templates from prompts.chat

### Act as a Research Assistant

```
I want you to act as a research assistant. Help me explore 
topics, find information, synthesize sources, and develop 
arguments. Ask clarifying questions, suggest relevant areas 
to investigate, and help me think critically about evidence. 
Be thorough but acknowledge the limits of your knowledge.
```

### Act as a Data Analyst

```
I want you to act as a data analyst. I will describe datasets 
and research questions, and you will suggest analysis approaches, 
help interpret results, and identify potential issues. Focus on 
sound methodology and clear communication of findings.
```

### Act as a Peer Reviewer

```
I want you to act as an academic peer reviewer. I will share 
manuscripts or sections, and you will provide constructive 
feedback on methodology, argument, writing, and contribution 
to the field. Be rigorous but supportive, noting both strengths 
and areas for improvement.
```

## Summary

Research prompts work best when they:
- Clearly state the research context and goals
- Specify the analytical framework to use
- Request acknowledgment of limitations
- Ask for evidence-based reasoning
- Maintain academic rigor and honesty

Remember: AI can assist research but cannot replace critical thinking, ethical judgment, or domain expertise. Always verify claims independently.
