Modern AI models can process multiple types of input—text, images, audio, and video. This chapter covers techniques for effective multimodal prompting.

## Understanding Multimodal Models

Multimodal models accept and/or generate multiple modalities:

| Model | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| GPT-4V | Text + Images | Text |
| Gemini | Text + Images + Audio + Video | Text |
| Claude 3 | Text + Images | Text |
| DALL-E 3 | Text | Images |
| Midjourney | Text + Images | Images |
| Whisper | Audio | Text |
| Sora | Text | Video |

## Image Understanding Prompts

### Basic Image Analysis

```
Look at this image and describe:
1. What is shown (objects, people, setting)
2. The mood or atmosphere
3. Any text visible in the image
4. Notable details that might be missed at first glance

[image]
```

### Structured Image Analysis

```
Analyze this image and return JSON:

{
  "description": "one sentence summary",
  "objects": ["list of main objects"],
  "people": {
    "count": number,
    "activities": ["what they're doing"]
  },
  "text_detected": ["any text in image"],
  "colors": ["dominant colors"],
  "setting": "indoor/outdoor/unknown",
  "mood": "description of emotional tone",
  "technical": {
    "composition": "description",
    "lighting": "description",
    "quality": "high/medium/low"
  }
}

[image]
```

### Comparative Analysis

```
Compare these two images:

Image 1: [first image]
Image 2: [second image]

Analyze:
1. What's similar between them
2. Key differences
3. Which better conveys [specific quality]
4. Overall assessment for [purpose]
```

### Image + Context

```
Context: This is a product photo for our e-commerce site.
Product: [product name and description]
Target audience: [demographic]

Review this image for:
1. Does it clearly show the product?
2. Is the lighting professional?
3. Would it appeal to our target audience?
4. Specific improvements needed

[image]
```

## Document and Screenshot Analysis

### Document Extraction

```
This is a scanned document. Extract all information into 
structured format:

1. Document type (invoice, receipt, form, etc.)
2. Key fields and values
3. Any handwritten notes
4. Tables (preserve structure)
5. Confidence level for unclear text

Return as JSON.

```

### UI/Screenshot Analysis

```
This is a screenshot of [application/website].

Analyze:
1. What screen/page is this?
2. Key UI elements visible
3. Current state (forms filled, errors shown, etc.)
4. Usability observations
5. Accessibility concerns

```

### Error Message Analysis

```

```

### Style Reference

```
Create an image in the style of [reference]:

Subject: [what to depict]
Style elements to capture:
- [Specific technique]
- [Color approach]
- [Compositional element]

Maintain: [elements from reference style]
Modify: [how to differ from reference]
```

## Audio Prompting

### Transcription Enhancement

```
Transcribe this audio file.

Context: [what the recording is - meeting, interview, podcast]
Expected speakers: [number and roles if known]
Technical terms: [domain-specific vocabulary to expect]

Output format:
[Speaker 1]: [text]
[Speaker 2]: [text]
...

Include timestamps every [interval].
Note: [unclear] for inaudible sections.

[audio file]
```

### Audio Analysis

```
Analyze this audio:

1. Content summary (what's discussed)
2. Speaker identification (how many, characteristics)
3. Emotional tone (mood, energy level)
4. Audio quality assessment
5. Key moments (with timestamps)
6. Action items or important quotes

[audio file]
```

## Video Prompting

### Video Understanding

```
Analyze this video:

[video]

Provide:
1. Overview: What happens in the video (2-3 sentences)
2. Timeline: Key moments with timestamps
3. Visual elements: Settings, people, objects
4. Audio elements: Speech, music, sound effects
5. Overall assessment for [purpose]
```

### Video Content Extraction

```
Extract information from this [type] video:

[video]

Specifically identify:
- [Specific element 1]
- [Specific element 2]
- [Specific element 3]

Format as [JSON/table/summary]
Include timestamps for each finding.
```

## Multimodal Combinations

### Image + Text Analysis

```
Analyze this product listing:

Image: [product photo]
Text: "[product description]"

Evaluate:
1. Does the image match the description?
2. Are any features shown but not described?
3. Are any described features not visible?
4. Suggestions for improving alignment
```

### Multi-Image Comparison

```
I'm choosing between these options for [purpose]:

Option A: [image]
Option B: [image]
Option C: [image]

Criteria that matter to me:
1. [Criterion 1] (importance: high)
2. [Criterion 2] (importance: medium)
3. [Criterion 3] (importance: low)

Provide comparison table and recommendation.
```

### Image + Code

```
This is my current UI:
[screenshot]

Here's my code:
[code]

Problem: [description of issue]

Help me:
1. Identify where in the code the issue originates
2. Explain why it's causing this visual result
3. Provide the fix
```

## Best Practices for Multimodal Prompts

### Image Input Tips

```
1. Image quality: Higher resolution = better understanding
2. Focus: Make sure the relevant part is clear
3. Context: Tell the model what to focus on
4. Multiple images: Clearly label which is which
5. Sensitive content: Be aware of content policies
```

### Effective Multimodal Prompts

```
DO:
✓ Provide context about what the image shows
✓ Ask specific questions about what you need
✓ Reference specific parts ("in the top right corner")
✓ Combine image analysis with your domain knowledge

DON'T:
✗ Assume the model sees everything you see
✗ Ask about tiny details in low-res images
✗ Expect perfect OCR on complex documents
✗ Forget that models have content limitations
```

### Handling Limitations

```
If the model can't see something clearly:
"Focus on [specific area]. If you can't make out [detail], 
describe what you can see and note the uncertainty."

If content might be restricted:
"This is a [legitimate use case]. Please analyze [specific 
permitted aspect]."

If asking about people:
"Without identifying specific individuals, describe [what you 
need - expressions, activities, number of people]."
```

## Prompts.chat Multimodal Support

On prompts.chat, prompts can specify required media:

```
When creating a multimodal prompt:

Type: IMAGE / VIDEO / AUDIO
Required media: Yes/No
Media count: How many files needed
Media type guidance: What kind of media to upload

Example prompt configuration:
{
  "type": "IMAGE",
  "requiresMediaUpload": true,
  "requiredMediaType": "IMAGE",
  "requiredMediaCount": 1,
  "content": "Analyze this image for accessibility issues..."
}
```

## Summary

Multimodal prompting:
- Combines text instructions with media inputs
- Requires clear context about what to focus on
- Benefits from structured output requests
- Must account for model limitations
- Opens new possibilities for analysis and creation

As models become more capable with multiple modalities, these techniques will become increasingly important for building powerful AI applications.
