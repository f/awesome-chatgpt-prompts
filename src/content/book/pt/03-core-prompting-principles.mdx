Beyond structure, effective prompt engineering is guided by principles—fundamental truths that apply across models, tasks, and contexts. Master these principles, and you'll be able to adapt to any prompting challenge.

<Callout type="info" title="The 8 Core Principles">
These principles apply to every AI model and every task. Learn them once, use them everywhere.
</Callout>

## Principle 1: Clarity Over Cleverness

The best prompts are clear, not clever. AI models are literal interpreters—they work with exactly what you give them.

### Be Explicit

<Compare 
  before={{ label: "Implicit (problematic)", content: "Make this better." }}
  after={{ label: "Explicit (effective)", content: "Improve this email by:\n1. Making the subject line more compelling\n2. Shortening paragraphs to 2-3 sentences max\n3. Adding a clear call-to-action at the end" }}
/>

### Avoid Ambiguity

Words can have multiple meanings. Choose precise language.

<Compare 
  before={{ label: "Ambiguous", content: "Give me a short summary.\n(How short? 1 sentence? 1 paragraph? 1 page?)" }}
  after={{ label: "Precise", content: "Summarize in exactly 3 bullet points, each under 20 words." }}
/>

### State the Obvious

What's obvious to you isn't obvious to the model. Spell out assumptions.

```
You're helping me write a cover letter.

Important context:
- I'm applying for a Software Engineer position at Google
- I have 5 years of experience in Python and distributed systems
- The role requires leadership experience (I've led a team of 4)
- I want to emphasize my open-source contributions
```

## Principle 2: Specificity Yields Quality

Vague inputs produce vague outputs. Specific inputs produce specific, useful outputs.

### The Specificity Ladder

<SpecificitySpectrum levels={[
  { level: "Level 1", text: "Write about climate change" },
  { level: "Level 2", text: "Write an article about climate change effects" },
  { level: "Level 3", text: "Write a 500-word article about how climate change affects coral reefs" },
  { level: "Level 4", text: "Write a 500-word article explaining how rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, aimed at high school students, with 2 specific examples from the Great Barrier Reef, in an engaging but scientifically accurate tone" }
]} />

Each level adds specificity and dramatically improves output quality.

### Specify These Elements

<div className="my-4 grid gap-2">
  <div className="flex gap-2 p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <span className="font-semibold min-w-24">Audience</span>
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">Who will read/use this?</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex gap-2 p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <span className="font-semibold min-w-24">Length</span>
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">How long/short should it be?</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex gap-2 p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <span className="font-semibold min-w-24">Tone</span>
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">Formal? Casual? Technical?</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex gap-2 p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <span className="font-semibold min-w-24">Format</span>
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">Prose? List? Table? Code?</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex gap-2 p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <span className="font-semibold min-w-24">Scope</span>
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">What to include/exclude?</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex gap-2 p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <span className="font-semibold min-w-24">Purpose</span>
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">What should this accomplish?</span>
  </div>
</div>

## Principle 3: Context Is King

Models have no memory, no access to your files, and no knowledge of your situation. Everything relevant must be in the prompt.

### Provide Sufficient Context

<Compare 
  before={{ label: "Insufficient context", content: "Why isn't my function working?" }}
  after={{ label: "Sufficient context", content: "I have a Python function that should filter a list of dictionaries by a specific key value. It's returning an empty list when it should return 3 items.\n\nFunction:\ndef filter_items(items, key, value):\n    return [item for item in items if item[key] = value]\n\nCall: filter_items(items, 'status', 'active')\nExpected: 2 items, Got: empty list" }}
/>

### The Context Checklist

<Callout type="tip" title="Before You Submit">
Ask yourself: Would a smart stranger understand this request? If not, add more context.
</Callout>

<Checklist 
  title="Context Checklist"
  items={[
    { text: "Does the model know what I'm working on?" },
    { text: "Does it know my goal?" },
    { text: "Does it have all necessary information?" },
    { text: "Does it understand the constraints?" },
    { text: "Would a smart stranger understand this request?" }
  ]}
/>

## Principle 4: Guide, Don't Just Ask

Don't just ask for an answer—guide the model toward the answer you want.

### Use Instructional Framing

<Compare 
  before={{ label: "Just Asking", content: "What are the pros and cons of microservices?" }}
  after={{ label: "Guiding", content: "List 5 advantages and 5 disadvantages of microservices architecture.\n\nFor each point:\n- State the point clearly in one sentence\n- Provide a brief explanation (2-3 sentences)\n- Give a concrete example\n\nConsider perspectives of: small startups, large enterprises, and teams transitioning from monoliths." }}
/>

### Provide Reasoning Scaffolds

For complex tasks, guide the reasoning process:

<TryIt 
  title="Reasoning Scaffold Example"
  description="This prompt guides the AI through a systematic decision-making process."
  prompt={`I need to choose between PostgreSQL and MongoDB for my e-commerce project.

Think through this systematically:
1. First, list the typical requirements for an e-commerce database
2. Then, evaluate each database against each requirement
3. Consider trade-offs specific to my use case
4. Make a recommendation with clear justification`}
/>

## Principle 5: Iterate and Refine

Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Your first prompt is rarely your best.

### The Iteration Cycle

```
1. Write initial prompt
2. Review output
3. Identify gaps or issues
4. Refine prompt
5. Repeat until satisfied
```

### Common Refinements

<div className="my-4 grid gap-2">
  <div className="flex gap-2 p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <span className="font-semibold min-w-32">Too verbose</span>
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">Add "Be concise" or length limits</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex gap-2 p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <span className="font-semibold min-w-32">Too vague</span>
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">Add specific examples or constraints</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex gap-2 p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <span className="font-semibold min-w-32">Wrong format</span>
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">Specify exact output structure</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex gap-2 p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <span className="font-semibold min-w-32">Missing aspects</span>
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">Add "Make sure to include..."</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex gap-2 p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <span className="font-semibold min-w-32">Wrong tone</span>
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">Specify audience and style</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex gap-2 p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <span className="font-semibold min-w-32">Inaccurate</span>
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">Request citations or step-by-step reasoning</span>
  </div>
</div>

### Keep a Prompt Journal

Document what works:
```
Task: Code review
Version 1: "Review this code" → Too generic
Version 2: Added specific review criteria → Better
Version 3: Added example of good review → Excellent
Final: [Save successful prompt as template]
```

## Principle 6: Leverage the Model's Strengths

Work with how models are trained, not against them.

### Models Want to Be Helpful

Frame requests as things a helpful assistant would naturally do:

<Compare 
  before={{ label: "Against the grain", content: "I know you can't do this, but try to..." }}
  after={{ label: "With the grain", content: "Help me understand...\nI'm working on X and need assistance with...\nCould you walk me through..." }}
/>

### Models Excel at Patterns

If you need consistent output, show the pattern:

<TryIt 
  title="Pattern Example"
  description="This prompt shows the AI exactly what format you want for book recommendations."
  prompt={`Recommend 3 science fiction books. Format each recommendation as:

📚 **[Title]** by [Author]
*[Genre] | [Publication Year]*
[2-sentence description]
Why you'll love it: [1 sentence hook]

---`}
/>

### Models Can Role-Play

Use personas to access different "modes" of response:

```
As a devil's advocate, argue against my proposal...
As a supportive mentor, help me improve...
As a skeptical investor, question this business plan...
```

## Principle 7: Control Output Structure

Structured outputs are more useful than free-form text.

### Request Specific Formats

```
Return your analysis as:

SUMMARY: [1 sentence]

KEY FINDINGS:
• [Finding 1]
• [Finding 2]
• [Finding 3]

RECOMMENDATION: [1-2 sentences]

CONFIDENCE: [Low/Medium/High] because [reason]
```

### Use Delimiters

Clearly separate sections of your prompt:

```
### CONTEXT ###
[Your context here]

### TASK ###
[Your task here]

### FORMAT ###
[Desired format here]
```

### Request Machine-Readable Output

For programmatic use:

```
Return only valid JSON, no explanation:
{
  "decision": "approve" | "reject" | "review",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasons": ["string array"]
}
```

## Principle 8: Verify and Validate

Never blindly trust model outputs, especially for important tasks.

### Ask for Reasoning

```
Solve this problem and show your work step by step.
After solving, verify your answer by [checking method].
```

### Request Multiple Perspectives

```
Give me three different approaches to solve this problem.
For each, explain the trade-offs.
```

### Build in Self-Checking

```
After generating the code, review it for:
- Syntax errors
- Edge cases
- Security vulnerabilities
List any issues found.
```
