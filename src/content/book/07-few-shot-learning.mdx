Few-shot learning is one of the most powerful prompting techniques. By providing examples of what you want, you can teach the model complex tasks without any fine-tuning.

<Callout type="info" title="Learn by Example">
Just like humans learn by seeing examples, AI models can learn patterns from the examples you provide in your prompt.

## What is Few-Shot Learning?

Few-shot learning shows the model examples of input-output pairs before asking it to perform the same task. The model learns the pattern from your examples and applies it to new inputs.

<div className="my-4 grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-2">
  <div className="p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg text-center">
    <div className="text-2xl font-bold">0</div>
    <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Zero-shot</div>
  </div>
  <div className="p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg text-center">
    <div className="text-2xl font-bold">1</div>
    <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">One-shot</div>
  </div>
  <div className="p-3 bg-primary/10 rounded-lg text-center border-2 border-primary">
    <div className="text-2xl font-bold">2-5</div>
    <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Few-shot</div>
  </div>
  <div className="p-3 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg text-center">
    <div className="text-2xl font-bold">5+</div>
    <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Many-shot</div>
  </div>
</div>

## Why Examples Work

<FewShotDemo />

Examples communicate:
- **Format** — How output should be structured
- **Style** — Tone, length, vocabulary
- **Logic** — The reasoning pattern to follow
- **Edge cases** — How to handle special situations

## Basic Few-Shot Pattern

```
[Example 1]
Input: [input 1]
Output: [output 1]

[Example 2]
Input: [input 2]
Output: [output 2]

[Example 3]
Input: [input 3]
Output: [output 3]

Now do this one:
Input: [new input]
Output:
```

## Few-Shot for Classification

### Sentiment Analysis

```
Classify the sentiment of these customer reviews.

immediately send a replacement at no charge. You don't need to 
return the damaged item. May I confirm your shipping address?"

## Example Quality Matters

### Good Examples Are:
- **Clear** — Unambiguous input-output mapping
- **Diverse** — Cover different scenarios
- **Representative** — Match real-world cases
- **Consistent** — Follow the same format
- **Correct** — No errors for the model to learn

### Bad Examples:
- Ambiguous or contradictory
- All too similar to each other
- Contain errors
- Inconsistent formatting
- Too complex or simple

## Combining Few-Shot with Other Techniques

### Few-Shot + Role

```
You are a legal contract reviewer.

[examples of contract clause analysis]

Now analyze: [new clause]
```

### Few-Shot + CoT

```
Classify and explain reasoning.

Review: "Great features but overpriced"
Thinking: The review mentions positive aspects ("great features") 
but also a significant negative ("overpriced"). The negative seems 
to outweigh the positive based on the "but" conjunction.
Classification: Mixed-Negative

[more examples with reasoning]

Now classify with reasoning:
Review: "Exactly what I needed, arrived faster than expected"
```

## Summary

<Callout type="tip" title="Key Takeaways">
Few-shot learning teaches through demonstration and is often more effective than instructions alone. Use 2-5 diverse, correct examples and combine with other techniques for best results.
