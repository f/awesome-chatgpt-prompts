## The Magic of Words

When you talk to AI, every word matters! Let's see how adding more words makes prompts better.

<WordPredictor
  title="Why Words Matter"
  instruction="Remember how I guess the next word? Watch what happens with prompts!"
  sentence="Write a story about a ___"
  options={["dragon", "thing", "the", "very"]}
  correctAnswer="dragon"
  explanation="'Dragon' makes the most sense because stories are usually about characters or things! 'Thing' is too vague, and 'the' or 'very' don't fit the pattern."
  aiThinking="Stories are usually about someone or something interesting..."
  successMessage="Exactly! Specific words guide my predictions - that's why details matter in prompts!"
/>

<Panel character="promi" mood="thinking">
Watch this! If someone just says "cat" to me, I don't know what they want. Do they want a picture? A story? Facts about cats? I'm confused! 😵‍💫

## Building Better Prompts

A good prompt has **three parts**:

1. **What you want** (a story, help, information)
2. **The topic** (cats, space, dinosaurs)
3. **Details** (short, funny, for kids)

  pieces={[
    "Please write",
    "a short story",
    "about a brave kitten",
    "who goes on an adventure"
  ]}
  correctOrder={[0, 1, 2, 3]}

<MagicWords

  blanks={[
    { id: "type", hint: "What kind of writing? (story, poem, song)", answers: ["story", "poem", "song", "letter", "joke"], emoji: "📝" },
    { id: "character", hint: "Who is it about? (robot, dragon, puppy)", answers: ["robot", "dragon", "puppy", "cat", "wizard", "princess", "knight", "bunny", "unicorn"], emoji: "🦸" },
    { id: "action", hint: "What do they do? (finds treasure, makes friends, saves the day)", answers: ["finds treasure", "makes friends", "saves the day", "goes on adventure", "learns to fly", "finds a friend", "discovers magic"], emoji: "⚡" }
  ]}

## Your Turn to Choose!

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which prompt will get a better story?"
  good="Write a funny story about a penguin who wants to learn how to dance"
  bad="Write story penguin"
  explanation="The first prompt tells me it should be funny, it's about a penguin, AND what the penguin wants to do!"
  promiMessage="Details make everything better! I love knowing exactly what you want!"
/>
