Welcome back to Clarity Castle! Today we're learning about **WHO** and **WHAT** - two super important details!
</Panel>

## The WHO Question

When you ask AI for help, think: **Who is involved?**

- A person? (boy, girl, grandma, superhero)
- An animal? (cat, dragon, whale)
- A character? (robot, wizard, alien)

If you say "Write a story," I don't know who it's about! But "Write a story about a brave knight" tells me exactly who the main character is!

## Let's Practice WHO!

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which prompt tells us WHO the story is about?"
  good="Write a story about a curious little mouse named Pip"
  bad="Write a story about something"
  explanation="The first prompt tells us WHO (a mouse), WHAT kind (curious, little), and even their NAME (Pip)!"
  promiMessage="Names and descriptions help me picture the character!"
/>
</Section>

<Section>
## The WHAT Question

Now think: **What is happening? What do you want?**

- What action? (running, singing, building)
- What object? (a cake, a spaceship, a poem)
- What type? (funny, scary, colorful)

## Let's Practice WHAT!

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which prompt tells us WHAT to create?"
  good="Write a funny poem about pizza with lots of rhymes"
  bad="Write something funny"
  explanation="The detailed prompt tells us WHAT (a poem), WHAT about (pizza), WHAT style (funny with rhymes)!"
  promiMessage="Being specific about WHAT you want helps me create exactly that!"
/>
</Section>

## Build Your Own Prompt!

Put WHO and WHAT together:

<DragDropPrompt
  title="Build a Prompt"
  instruction="Drag the pieces into the right order"
  pieces={["Write a story", "about a friendly dragon", "who learns", "to make ice cream"]}
  correctOrder={[0, 1, 2, 3]}
  successMessage="Perfect! You combined WHO (friendly dragon) and WHAT (learns to make ice cream)!"
/>
</Section>
