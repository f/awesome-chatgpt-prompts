## The Power of Examples

Instead of just describing what you want, **show me an example**!

It's like when you're teaching someone a game - it's easier to show them how to play than just tell them the rules!

## Learn the Pattern!

<ExampleMatcher
  title="Pattern Power"
  instruction="AI learns from examples! See the pattern and pick what comes next."
  examples={[
    { input: "happy", output: "😊" },
    { input: "sad", output: "😢" },
    { input: "sleepy", output: "😴" }
  ]}
  question="angry"
  options={["😠", "😊", "🎉", "😴"]}
  correctAnswer="😠"
  explanation="The AI learned: feeling word → matching emoji! This is called 'learning by example' - just like you!"

If you say "make it sound cool," I might not know what "cool" means to you. But if you show me an example, I'll understand perfectly!

## See the Difference

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which prompt uses examples better?"
  good="Write a fun product name like 'Super Sparkle Shampoo' or 'Magic Cloud Pillows' - something catchy and playful!"
  bad="Write a fun product name"
  explanation="The examples show exactly what style of name you're looking for - catchy, playful, with fun adjectives!"
  promiMessage="Examples are like treasure maps - they show me exactly where you want to go!"

## Show Your Style

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which prompt better shows the writing style?"
  good="Write a joke in this style: 'Why did the banana go to the doctor? Because it wasn't peeling well!' - something silly with a pun!"
  bad="Write a funny joke"
  explanation="By showing an example joke with a pun, I know you want that same silly wordplay style!"
  promiMessage="When you show me what you like, I can match that style!"
/>

## Give Examples!

<DragDropPrompt
  title="Build with Examples"
  instruction="Arrange the pieces to create a prompt with a helpful example"
  pieces={["Write a superhero name", "like 'Captain Courage'", "or 'Lightning Lady'", "- something heroic and memorable"]}
  correctOrder={[0, 1, 2, 3]}
  successMessage="Perfect! Your examples show exactly what kind of name you want!"
