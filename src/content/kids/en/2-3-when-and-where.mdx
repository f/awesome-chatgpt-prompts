"A story about a cat" is okay, but "A story about a cat on a spooky Halloween night" is SO much more interesting!

## Let's Practice WHEN!

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which prompt has a better sense of WHEN?"
  good="Write about a snowman who wakes up on a warm spring morning"
  bad="Write about a snowman"
  explanation="The first prompt tells us WHEN (spring morning) which creates an interesting problem - a snowman in spring! That's a great story idea!"
  promiMessage="WHEN can create exciting situations in your stories!"
/>

## Let's Practice WHERE!

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which prompt paints a better picture of WHERE?"
  good="Write about pirates searching for treasure on a mysterious foggy island"
  bad="Write about pirates searching for treasure"

  promiMessage="WHERE helps set the mood and atmosphere of your story!"
/>
