Do you know what **AI** means? AI stands for **Artificial Intelligence**. That's a fancy way of saying "a computer that can think and talk!"

I'm an AI! I can read your messages and try to help you. But here's the secret... I need **good instructions** to do my best work!

## What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is just a fancy word for the message you send to an AI like me.

Think of it like giving directions to a friend. If you say "Go there!" your friend won't know where to go. But if you say "Go to the red house on Maple Street," they'll know exactly where!

When you write a good prompt, I can understand what you want and help you better! Let's practice!
</Panel>

## Let's Try It!

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which message would help Promi understand better?"
  good="Please write a short story about a friendly dragon who loves to bake cookies"
  bad="story"
  explanation="The first message tells Promi exactly what kind of story to write! The second one is too short - Promi doesn't know what kind of story you want."
  promiMessage="See? More details help me understand what you want!"
/>

## Quick Quiz!

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which is a prompt?"
  good="Can you help me write a poem about the ocean?"
  bad="🌊"
  explanation="A prompt uses words to tell the AI what you need. Emojis are fun but they don't give enough information!"
  promiMessage="Words are my superpower! The more you tell me, the better I can help!"
/>
