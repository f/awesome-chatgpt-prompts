Do you know what **AI** means? AI stands for **Artificial Intelligence**. That's a fancy way of saying "a computer that can think and talk!"

I'm an AI! I can read your messages and try to help you. But here's the secret... I need **good instructions** to do my best work!

## How Do I Think? 🧠

Want to know my secret? I don't actually "think" like you do. I read words and guess what word should come next!

<WordPredictor
  title="Think Like AI!"
  instruction="I read patterns and guess the next word. What would YOU guess?"
  sentence="The cat sat on the ___"
  options={["mat", "moon", "purple", "keyboard"]}
  correctAnswer="mat"
  explanation="'Mat' is the most common word that follows 'The cat sat on the' because it's a famous rhyme! AI learns these patterns from reading lots of text."
  aiThinking="I've seen 'The cat sat on the mat' many times before..."
  successMessage="You think like AI! I pick the most likely word based on patterns."
/>

<WordPredictor
  title="One More Try!"
  instruction="Now you're getting it! What word fits best here?"
  sentence="Once upon a ___"
  options={["time", "banana", "quickly", "green"]}
  correctAnswer="time"
  explanation="'Once upon a time' is how almost every fairy tale starts! AI has read thousands of stories that begin this way."
  aiThinking="This sounds like a story beginning... I've seen this pattern so many times!"
  successMessage="Perfect! You're already thinking like AI - recognizing patterns!"
/>

## What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is just a fancy word for the message you send to an AI like me.

Think of it like giving directions to a friend. If you say "Go there!" your friend won't know where to go. But if you say "Go to the red house on Maple Street," they'll know exactly where!

## Let's Try It!

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which message would help Promi understand better?"
  good="Please write a short story about a friendly dragon who loves to bake cookies"
  bad="story"
  explanation="The first message tells Promi exactly what kind of story to write! The second one is too short - Promi doesn't know what kind of story you want."
  promiMessage="See? More details help me understand what you want!"
/>

## Quick Quiz!

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which is a prompt?"
  good="Can you help me write a poem about the ocean?"
  bad="🌊"
  explanation="A prompt uses words to tell the AI what you need. Emojis are fun but they don't give enough information!"
  promiMessage="Words are my superpower! The more you tell me, the better I can help!"
