Hey superstar! 🌟 Today we're going to learn the most important skill: being **CLEAR**!

## Why Being Clear Matters

Imagine asking your mom for "food" vs asking for "a peanut butter sandwich with no crust." Which one gets you exactly what you want?

<Panel character="promi" mood="thinking">
It's the same with me! When you're clear, I know exactly how to help. When you're vague, I have to guess... and I might guess wrong!

## Clear vs. Unclear

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which prompt is clearer?"
  good="Write a 4-line poem about butterflies in a garden, using rhyming words"
  bad="Write poem butterflies"
  explanation="The clear prompt tells me: how long (4 lines), what about (butterflies in a garden), and a special rule (rhyming). Much better!"
  promiMessage="Clear prompts = better results! It's like magic!"
/>
</Section>

<Section>
<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which one tells me exactly what you need?"
  good="Help me write 3 fun facts about dolphins that a 10-year-old would enjoy"
  bad="Tell me about dolphins"
  explanation="The first prompt tells me: how many facts (3), what kind (fun), and who it's for (10-year-old). That helps a lot!"
  promiMessage="When you tell me who it's for, I can make it perfect for them!"

## The Golden Rules of Clarity

<Panel character="promi" mood="excited">
Here are my top tips for being clear:
</Panel>

Remember these three questions when writing a prompt:

1. **WHAT** do I want? (story, help, information)
2. **HOW** should it be? (short, funny, simple)
3. **WHO** is it for? (me, my friend, my class)
</Section>

<Section>
<PromptVsMistake
  question="Final challenge! Which uses all three rules?"
  good="Write a short, funny joke about pizza that I can tell my friends at lunch"
  bad="Make something funny"
  explanation="The great prompt has WHAT (a joke about pizza), HOW (short and funny), and WHO (for telling friends at lunch)!"
