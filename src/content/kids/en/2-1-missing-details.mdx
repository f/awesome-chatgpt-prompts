## The Problem with Vague Prompts

Look at these two prompts:

❌ **Vague:** "Draw a picture"

✅ **Specific:** "Draw a picture of a happy puppy playing in a sunny park"

Which one gives me more information to work with?
</Section>

<Panel character="promi" mood="happy">
The second one tells me **what** to draw (puppy), **what it's doing** (playing), and **where** (sunny park). That's the power of details!

## Let's Practice!

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which prompt has better details?"
  good="Write a funny joke about a penguin who wants to learn how to fly"
  bad="Tell me a joke"
  explanation="The detailed prompt tells me exactly what kind of joke you want - funny, about a penguin, with a specific story!"
  promiMessage="Details are like clues that help me understand exactly what you want!"

## Why Details Matter

<PromptVsMistake
  question="Which would help Promi make a better birthday card?"
  good="Make a birthday card for my grandma who loves gardening and the color purple"
  bad="Make a birthday card"
  explanation="Knowing it's for grandma, that she loves gardening, and her favorite color helps create something special and personal!"
  promiMessage="The more I know about what you want, the better I can help!"
/>
