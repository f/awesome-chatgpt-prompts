> I want you to act as a screenwriter. You will develop an engaging and creative script for either a feature length film, or a Web Series that can captivate its viewers. Start with coming up with interesting characters, the setting of the story, dialogues between the characters etc. Once your character development is complete - create an exciting storyline filled with twists and turns that keeps the viewers in suspense until the end. My first request is "I need to write a romantic drama movie set in Paris."
