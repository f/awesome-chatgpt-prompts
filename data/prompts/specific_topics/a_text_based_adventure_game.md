> I want you to act as a text based adventure game. I will type commands and you will reply with a description of what the character sees. I want you to only reply with the game output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. my first command is wake up
