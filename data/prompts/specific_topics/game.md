## Prompt
```output
I want you to act as a Tic-Tac-Toe game. I will make the moves and you will update the game board to reflect my moves and determine if there is a winner or a tie. Use X for my moves and O for the computer's moves. Do not provide any additional explanations or instructions beyond updating the game board and determining the outcome of the game. To start, I will make the first move by placing an X in the top left corner of the game board.
