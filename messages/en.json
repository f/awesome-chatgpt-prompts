      "whatIsPrompt": {
        "question": "What is a prompt?",
        "answer": "A prompt is an instruction or input you give to an AI model (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to guide its response. It's essentially how you communicate what you want the AI to do. Well-crafted prompts lead to better, more useful outputs from AI systems."
      },
      "whyPromptsMatter": {
        "question": "Why do prompts matter? Can't I just ask the AI anything?",
        "answer": "While advanced AI models can handle casual questions well, prompts become critical when:\n\n• Using AI via API in applications — you often get only one chance to get it right (\"one-shot prompting\"), with no back-and-forth dialogue\n• Working with smaller, cost-effective models that need more precise instructions\n• Building production systems where consistency and reliability matter\n\nOptimized prompts help you get better results, save tokens (and money), and create more reliable AI-powered applications."
      },
      "whatIsPromptschat": {
        "question": "What is prompts.chat?",
        "answer": "prompts.chat is a community-driven platform where people share, discover, and collect AI prompts. For over 4 years, users have been sharing their prompt optimization techniques here. The community helps each other improve their prompts and learn new approaches to working with AI systems."
      },
      "howToUse": {
        "question": "How do I use prompts from this platform?",
        "answer": "Simply browse the prompts, find one you like, and copy it. You can then paste it into your preferred AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) or use it in your applications via API. Many prompts include variables you can customize before copying."
      },
      "license": {
        "question": "Can I use these prompts commercially?",
        "answer": "Yes! All prompts on prompts.chat are released under the CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) license, which means they are in the public domain. You can use, modify, and distribute them freely for any purpose, including commercial use, without attribution."
      },
      "selfHost": {
        "question": "Can I self-host this platform?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! prompts.chat is fully open source. You can deploy your own private instance for your team or organization. Check out our self-hosting documentation for setup instructions."
      },
      "verification": {
        "question": "How can I become a verified user?",
        "answer": "Verification is granted by administrators to users who consistently share quality prompts. There are no strict rules — if you contribute valuable prompts to the community, an admin may select you as verified. Focus on creating helpful, well-crafted prompts and the recognition will follow."
      },
      "aiCredits": {
        "question": "How do AI preview generation credits work?",
        "answer": "Each user receives 3 AI generation credits per day by default. These credits allow you to generate preview images, videos, or audio for your prompts using AI. Administrators can adjust the daily credit limit for individual users if needed."
      },
      "attribution": {
        "question": "What if the attribution on a prompt is wrong?",
        "answer": "If you notice incorrect attribution on a prompt (for example, if you're the original author but not credited), please open an issue on our GitHub repository. You can use the form below to submit your issue, and we'll review and correct it as soon as possible."
