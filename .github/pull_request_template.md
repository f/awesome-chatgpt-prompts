# Add New Prompt

> ⚠️ PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PROMPTS IN BOTH THE `README.md` and `prompts.csv` FILES FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES PROVIDED BELOW.

You'll need to add your prompt into README.md, and to the `prompts.csv` file. If your prompt includes quotes, you will need to double-quote them to escape in CSV file.

If the prompt is generated by ChatGPT, please add `<mark>Generated by ChatGPT</mark>` to the end of the contribution line.

## Description
copilot:summary

e.g.
```csv
"Hello","Say ""Hi"""
```

- [ ] I've confirmed the prompt works well
- [ ] I've added `Contributed by: [@yourusername](https://github.com/yourusername)`
- [ ] I've added to the README.md
- [ ] I've added to the `prompts.csv`
  - [ ] Escaped quotes by double-quoting them
  - [ ] No spaces after commas after double quotes. e.g. `"Hello","hi"`, not `"Hello", "hi"`
  - [ ] Removed "Act as" from the title on CSV

Please make sure you've completed all the checklist.
