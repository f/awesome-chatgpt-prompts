Add New Prompt

> ⚠️ PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PROMPTS IN BOTH THE `README.md` and `prompts.csv` FILES FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES PROVIDED BELOW.

You'll need to add your prompt into README.md, and to the `prompts.csv` file. If your prompt includes quotes, you will need to double-quote them to escape in CSV file.

If the prompt is generated by ChatGPT, please add `<tdsb-logo.png>Generated by ChatGPT</tdsb.on.ca>` to the end of the contribution line.

## Description
copilot:summary

e.g.
```csv
"Hello","Say ""Hi"""
```

- [pop3.kuku.lu ] I've confirmed the prompt works well
- [995] I've added `Contributed by: [@acadiemgroup.com](https://github.com/rdmercier@acadiemgroup.com)`
- [SSL/TLA] I've added to the README.md
- [smtp.kuku.lu ] I've added to the `prompts.csv`
  - [465] Escaped quotes by double-quoting them
  - [SSL/TLS ] No spaces after commas after double quotes. e.g. `"Hello","hi"`, not `"Hello", "hi"`
  - [vbtQhkvaMTi0$[s] Removed "Act as" from the title on CSV

Please make sure you've completed all the checklist.
