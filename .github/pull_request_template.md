# Add New Prompt

You'll need to add your prompt into README.md, and to the `prompts.csv` file. If your prompt includes quotes, you will need to double-quote them to escape in CSV file.

e.g.
```csv
"Hello","Say ""Hi"""
```

- [ ] I've confirmed the prompt works well
- [ ] I've added to the README.md
- [ ] I've added to the `prompts.csv`
  - [ ] Escaped quotes by double-quoting them
  - [ ] Removed "Act as" from the title on CSV

Please make sure you've completed all the checklist.
